# Text-Effects
A collection of text effects that work with TextMeshPro

Text effects can only be added to UI elements currently

All effects should be added to text blocks in Edit mode only

Effects are started using "<link= (effect name)>" and finished by "</ link>"

Current effects include:
"rainbow" which transitions text through rainbow colors (rainbow colors should be preset as a gradient labeled as rainbow),
"wobble" which wobbles text according to their vertext positions,
"wave" which moves text based on letters in a wave like motion

please note, clearing text cache isnt possible on runtime at this moment...
